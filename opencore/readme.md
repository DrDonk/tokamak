# OpenCore Boot disk
There is a known [problem](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-Fusion-Discussions/Can-t-boot-into-recovery-partition-on-macOS-11-Big-Sur/m-p/2298420#M139994) in VMware Fusion 12, where it is not possible to boot to Recovery Mode. 
The OpenCore boot loader is capable of booting to Recovery mode which means settings such as those for SIP
can be altered.

[TODO: Add details of how to use]
